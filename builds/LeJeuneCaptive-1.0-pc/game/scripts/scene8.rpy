    show Jean at center

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "Where is he? We were supposed to meet a half ho--"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    show Claude at right with moveinright

    Claude "Ah! Jean! There you are! How is our favorite Health minister doing?"

    Jean "Don't 'there you are' me! You're the one who is late. You could have let me know you were running behind, you know?"

    Claude "I'm sorry, mon ami. One of the new representatives submitted a new bill for discussion on the floor this afternoon. I was only just able to get away!"

    Jean "A bill? On Anniversary Day? What one earth was in it, that it could not wait until tomorrow?"

    Claude "Nothing. It was a waste of everyone's time. Ciel will tell you about it tonight, I think. She was so mad the boy nearly pissed himself there on the floor of parliament!"

    Jean "As she should. If he proposed it today, he was just looking for attention. He deserves all the disdain I'm sure she gave him."

    Claude "No kidding. But let's not waste any more time talking about that abruti, yeah? What did you think of Ciel's speech this morning? it was quite a winner, no?"

    Jean "..."

    Claude "Oh, and that dress! Surely you had no hand in helping her pick out such a delight for the eyes, eh? You looked like a total frump standing next to such a beauty."

    Jean "..."

    Claude "Oh, come on Jean. I know that long face. What do you have to worry about now?"

    Jean "Nothing. It's nothing."

    Claude "Ach. Like hell it is, Jean. Do you think you can fool your best friend like that? You are worried about something, I can tell."

    Jean "..."

    Claude "Is there trouble with Ciel? Is married life not all it was cut out to be?"

    Jean "Hah...You'd like that, wouldn't you."

    Claude "Moi? How can you insult me so! Have I not always been the strongest advocate of your love?"

    Jean "Yes, yes. It has nothing to do with my marriage. We are quite happy, I will have you know."

    Claude "Then what? I have heard stories, Jean. They say you walk through the halls listlessly. That something is always distracting you."

    Claude "Did you not call me here to talk about it? Let me help you, Jean. Have I ever let you down before?"

    Jean "Do you seriously want me t--"

    Claude "Hey, we agreed that the time at the noodle restaurant does not count, right? Have I let you down any other time?"

    Jean "Quite a fe--"

    Claude "I know I haven't! That is why our friendship is a bond no man can cut, yeah? Now tell me, what is eating you Jean? It must be politics, no?"

    Jean "...In a word, yes."

    Claude "Tell me, then!"

    Jean "...you will think I am crazy. That I am jumping at shadows."

    Claude "Of course I will not!"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Claude "Jean, mon ami. Just le--"

    Jean "Fine, fine! I will tell you, just shut up so I can think!"

    Claude "Do you treat your deputies this way?"

    Jean "My deputies have learned to blabber less and work more. Or been replaced by men who will."

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "It has been seven years now, Claude. Seven years since we won. We tore down the fifth republic, and built ourselves a sixth."

    Claude "Right. We won. What do you have to be so worried about? Ease up a little, yeah?"

    Jean "We won, but then what? We were going to change everything, were we not? And here we are, a decade after the revolution started, and where have we gotten?"

    Jean "Did we end austerity? No. The bill could not pass. Did we improve the unemployment system? No. Two years of your work, and the bill died...a vote short."

    Claude "But that is the price of a republic, Jean! We cannot change everything the way we see fit. We must listen to the people."

    Jean "Yes, but are we? Every time we've tried to do something we said we would -- that we swore we would -- it fails parliament by a single vote or two."

    Claude "That is not unusual. It happens all the time in America or Britai--"

    Jean "But if you ask the people, the bills are very popular. Why is a bill with 80\% approval getting 45\% of the vote?"

    Jean "Why are the representatives that kill these bills still in power? They are unpopular, no?"

    Claude "A bit, yes..."

    Jean "A bit? Claude, have you ever heard someone say Representative Louvillier's name without a curse before or after it? Yet he gets over 70\% of the vote in a district where he has a 20\% approval rating."

    Jean "The only way these men would still be in power, the only way all of our social changes could fail is if they were meant to. They are too popular otherwise!"

    Claude "Jean. Think about what you are saying! You're talking about some kind of conspiracy. And to what end?"

    Jean "You know what end, Claude. Revolution sans revolution."

    Claude "... ... ..."

    Claude "You don't think..."

    Jean "I do. It explains everything, does it not? It all has gone just how we said back then. We switched up all the actors, but the play remained the same."

    Claude "He did say there were others, but who? Who is so powerful that they could accomplish all of this without drawing suspicion? There is no one who is so beyond reproach...Is there?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "There is...one person..."

    Claude "No! Jean, you cannot seriously be thinking...no!"

    Jean "Who else could it be? There is no one else as powerful...or as popular."

    Claude "Jean, she's your wife! You cannot seriously suspect her."

    Jean "It is because she's my wife that it took me so long! Tell me it doesn't make sense, Claude! Does it not make everything fall into place?"

    Jean "We never knew how she got free, and she could not tell us, no? And does it not explain how the news ran her face for years on end, until she was the prime minister?"

    Jean "Tell me I am crazy, Claude, and I will never speak of it again! I will purge it from my thoughts! It will be a relief!"

    Claude "I...I don't..."

    Jean "You cannot, can you?"

    Claude "No. I cannot. It does make sense. But Jean, that does not make it true! We don't know that man could do anything he said he would!"

    Jean "Which is why we must find out."

    Claude "You're going to ask Ciel? If you are wrong, she will never forgive you!"

    Jean "What? No! That is precisely why we are not going to ask her. We will need to use more...subtle methods."

    Jean "If our hearts are right, and she had nothing to do with it, then she will never be the wiser, and we will be able to sleep more soundly at night, no?"

    Claude "But Jean...What if you are right? What will you do if Ciel is a traitor?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "I love Ciel more than this life. You know this. But I do not love her more than France. I would do what must be done. Can I count on you to do the same, Claude?"

    Claude "...Of course, but...I am sure it will not come to that. We will clear her name together, just like old times, yeah? Then we'll laugh at how foolish we were to suspect her."

    Jean "Yeah..."

    Claude "... ... ..."

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Claude "So...Where do we start?"
