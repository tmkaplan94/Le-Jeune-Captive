    Jean "And that’s it. Are you happy now, abruti?"

    Claude "Satisfied, yes. And what about you, dear? Was the story to your liking?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Well...Yes, but… I’m a bit confused about how they went from...that to the way they are now."

    Jean "I didn’t sign up to tell that story."

    Claude "Ah, you make it sound so difficult! It was simple familiarity. Talking started to feel normal for them, so they started spending every night together at the cafe. One night they had too much to drink, one thing led to another, and suddenly it felt normal for them to act a bit more...intimatel--"

    Jean "Claude!"

    Claude "Ah, forgive him, dear. Our arch-stoic here cannot bear to hear talk of things like laughter and love."

    Jean "That...What? I just told a love story!"

    Claude "You did not! Romance cannot be reduced to a single scene! It plants itself in your heart, quiet and unassuming."

    Claude "There it grows, day by day, hour by hour, until one day you wake up, and find you cannot escape its grip! To reduce it to a meeting in a cafe...It’s unthinkable!"

    Jean "And you know this based on what? Your vast experience?"

    Claude "Laugh all you want, mon ami. You’re the one depriving yourself of th--"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Umm...This is all very interesting, but...Shouldn’t we be doing something about everything that’s going on…?"

    Claude "Ah! Yes, yes! Right you are, my dead. So, Jean? Do you feel well enough to make us a plan?"

    Jean "*sigh*"

    Jean "We don’t know enough to plan our next move yet. We’ve only just located Ciel, and I have no idea where public opinion is yet. Do they think we are freedom fighters? Terrorists?"

    Jean "Our first line of business must be to answer these questions."

    Claude "And how shall we do that?"

    Jean "Well, first we have to stop holding our bites and telling stories."

    Jean "We need more information about where Ciel is being held, and the charges she faces. Then we can start figuring out how to get her out of there."

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "I can handle that! I know the place she’s being held, and my uncle is a gendarme captain and is sympathetic to our cause. He should be able to tell us what we need to know!"

    Jean "Good. Meet us back here tonight and let us know what you find. Oh! And if anything big comes up, let me know immediately. You have my number?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "I do. I’ll let you know right away if anything comes up!"

    Jean "Good. Then get to it. We may not have much time before they try to put her on trial."

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Got it! I’ll be back when I have something to report!"

    Jean "Do you need to be so dramatic about it…?"

    Claude "How could I not? When will my life be any more exciting than it is right now? When we are old and fat, we will look back on this time. You’ll see!"

    Jean "I would rather make sure we all make it long enough to become old. To do that, we need to know what people think of us. Not the media. Real people."

    Claude "Ahh. I think I catch your drift. I will make my normal rounds, and keep my ears open."

    Jean "And your mouth shut, Claude. We don’t know how dangerous it might be for us out there yet. Remember, it’s martial law out there. One slip up and we might need to make two rescues."

    Claude "You know me, mon ami! You’re worrying too much."

    Jean "*sigh*"

    Jean "Merde Claude. It’s because I know you that I worry. Just...Try to keep a low profile."

    Claude "Alright, alright. I’ll do my best. And what about you? What will you do?"

    Jean "I need to get in touch with the other protest groups. See where we all stand, and what help they can provide. There may be someone who can help Ciel out there."

    Claude "I hope you are right. We will not long survive with a dour blanket in charge."

    Jean "I’ll decide that. How do you know my name?"

    Shady_Statesman "I know much about you, Monsieur Hobier...And of your leader. Manque Bergier, wasn’t it? It’s a pity to see such a pretty little bird imprisoned, don’t you think?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "What do you want?"

    Shady_Statesman "For us to help one another. I have a proposition I think you will find...irresistable, considering the circumstances. Connections you will find...liberating."

    Claude "And why should we trust you?"

    Shady_Statesman "Because you have no other options? Your leader is in a gilded cage, and you’re both wanted men? Does not sound like the time to be turning down potential allies, does it?"

    Claude "Look at him! Do you think a man in a ten-thousand franc coat cares at all about men like us? He does not want to help us, he wants to use us!"

    Jean "That may be so, but we should still listen, no? If he is a dog, then we simply turn him loose after hearing what he has to say. Besides, he knew about Ciel. He may know how to help her."

    Claude "Or he could be trying to trap us with an offer too good to be true!"

    Jean "But why bother? He already knew where to find us, no? Why not simply arrest us in the dead of night?"

    Claude "I don’t know, and I don’t want to know. Let’s just tell him to get bent, yeah?"

    Jean "No...no. As much as I hate it, we cannot afford to not listen to him. We cannot be looking gift horses in the mouth, not when our list of friends is this short."

    Claude "Fine, fine. But if he is a dog, I'll toss him down the staircase."

    Shady_Statesman "An air freshener, at least."

    Jean "Enough. Stop wasting our time. What do you want?"

    Shady_Statesman "Hoho, they do say you always get straight to the point, Jean. May I call you Jean?"

    Jean "Call me whatever you want. Now tell us why you’re here, or baiche coupe."

    Shady_Statesman "Now, now. No need to get vulgar. We’re allies, after all."

    Jean "Are we? I did not see you in the crowd yesterday."

    Shady_Statesman "No. Indeed not. Yesterday we were enemies. But much has changed since then."

    Jean "Changed how?"

    Shady_Statesman "Well, thanks to your...efforts, this country has become a bomb waiting to go off. Macron overplayed his hand by bringing in the military."

    Shady_Statesman "We told him that if he left you alone, the public would just see you as a bunch of hooligans. Toddlers throwing a temper tantrum."

    Shady_Statesman "Alas, he did not listen, and now you are the next in the long line of our country’s righteous bands of freedom fighters. Your movement is a but a month old, and already Macron is losing the support of the people."

    Claude "He is?"

    show Jean at center

    Jean "Claude…"

    Shady_Statesman "Ah, so this is news to you? Have you not gone outside? The newscasters may have called it a riot, but that is not what they are saying in the clubs and cafes."

    Shady_Statesman "There is a video going around. One of a young, fiery haired woman leading a group of protestors away while screaming abuse at the military."

    show Jean flip at center

    Shady_Statesman "Her followers were gunned down around her, yet she did not flee. Instead, she hurled herself towards the gendarme, where she was beaten."

    Jean "Ciel…"

    Shady_Statesman "Yes, indeed. She has become quite an icon overnight. They are calling her the \"Redder Virgin\", as if the commune were still alive and well."

    Shady_Statesman "The truth is, yesterday was the greatest triumph you could have asked for. There is a tide of revolution coming, and we are considering breaking down the dams holding it back."

    Jean "‘We’? Who are you? What do you mean ‘break down the dams’?"

    Shady_Statesman "Do not trouble yourself wondering about who we are. We are concerned citizens, nothing more. Ones who can take the government propaganda off the air, and replace it with a narrative more...fitting for your cause."

    Shady_Statesman "This country is a powder keg, ripe to explode. We’re offering to help light the fuse."

    Jean "And what would that look like, exactly?"

    Shady_Statesman "Nothing criminal, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s amazing what a difference a few words can make. What if the newscasters started calling yesterday a \"massacre\", not a \"riot\"? Or said Macron’s measures were \"dictatorial\", not \"orderly\"?"

    Shady_Statesman "Ah, and most importantly...We would make sure your movement had its figurehead back, safe and sound."

    Jean "You would free Ciel? How?"

    Shady_Statesman "We have connections. The president is not the only man who takes our calls."

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Shady_Statesman "So, what do you say, Jean?"

    Jean "I say it all sounds too good to be true. You would do everything for us and ask nothing? I don’t believe it."

    Shady_Statesman "I did not say we would ask nothing. But the price is a small one, I think."

    Shady_Statesman "If we do this, we will do it all the way. You all will, eventually, become the new government of France. We merely ask that once you do, you heed our advice. Or we’ll find people who will."

    Jean "So you wish to make us your puppets?"

    Shady_Statesman "No, no. We merely want to ensure that you don’t act against our interests, is all. You would have free reign to pursue any other agenda you desire, as long as it doesn’t infringe on our business."

    Shady_Statesman "To put it clearly, we are happy to support your revolution as long as it is a political one. A social revolution, on the other hand…"

    Shady_Statesman "We would like very much to avoid that outcome. We desire a...revolution sans revolution, if you will."

    Jean "So you wish to swap out all the actors, but keep the play the same?"

    Shady_Statesman "Oh! What a colorful metaphor. Yes. We would like that."

    Jean "And in return you’ll give us Ciel?"

    Shady_Statesman "She will be safe in her bed by nightfall."

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "One moment. We must discuss."

    Shady_Statesman "Of course. I’m sure you will come to the...correct conclusion."

    Claude "What do you mean we need to discuss? There is nothing to discuss, is there? This man is clearly not our friend!"

    Jean "Maybe not, but…"

    Claude "But what? He will use us in the worst way, then dump us when he is done. Is he not already betraying Macron? Do you think he would not do the same to us?"

    Jean "C'est des conneries! No, of course not! I’m not a fool! But...What will happen to Ciel if we refuse? If she is as important as he says...You know they would never let her go."

    Claude "We would find a way, Jean! And besides, if she is that popular, they will not be able to harm her either, no? It would be a catastrophe for them!"

    Jean "Maybe so, but shooting into the crowd was as well. I do not believe that no one died yesterday. If they did not blink before committing that atrocity, what is to stop them from committing another?"

    Claude "Maybe. But which do you think Ciel would want? You know she would prefer prison to becoming this man’s puppet!"

    Jean "Of course she would! Can’t you see that is what I’m afraid of! You know she will not bend! If they put her on trial, she would curse the judge until he had no choice but to rebuild the bastille, just to put her in it!"

    Jean "If you do not bend, you can only break. And...I cannot bear to think of that happening to Ciel...And yet…"

    Claude "It will not, Jean! We will find a way. You heard him, the people are on our side! We will find other friends. Better friends!"

    Jean "And if we do not?"

    Claude "Then we do not, and the dice fall where they may. But our conscience would be clean, no? Is that not worth something?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "Like we’re figuring out a way to get out of the mess we’re already in? How is that going for us so far?"
