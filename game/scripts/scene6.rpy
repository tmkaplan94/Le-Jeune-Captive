    Claude "And that is the *real* first time Jean met Ciel."

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Wait, I remember hearing about some guy coming to our meeting and yelling at Ciel...That was you, Jean?"

    Jean "Well, I wasn’t really *yelling*..."

    Claude "Haha, you can’t be shy now, mon ami! Yes, it was him. We just try to keep that part a bit quiet, yeah? Seeing as he’s a big wig now and everything."

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "I see...That makes sense. So how did you go from *that* to being second in command? What was in the note?"

    Claude "You se--"

    show Jean at center

    Jean "Hey, you had your turn. This is my part of the story."

    Claude "Ok, ok. Take it away, then."

    Jean "I don’t need your permission, you know..."

    Claude "Then why did it sound like you were asking fo--"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Guys! Focus. The note?"

    Jean "Right, right. It was nothing much, just the name of a local cafe, and a time. It was just after finals, and I didn’t have anything else to do, so I went. Against my better judgment…"

    Ciel "Ah, there you are Monsieur Hobier! Come, come. Join me."

    Jean "You don’t seem surprised to see me."

    Ciel "Why should I be? Now, you *must* try the curry crepes. They are to die fo--"

    Jean "Cut the crap, what am I doing here?"

    Ciel "*sigh*"

    Ciel "Your reputation is well-deserved, I see."

    Jean "What reputation?"

    Ciel "*chuckles*"

    Ciel "You don’t know? Your reputation for being a connard, obviously. I think there’s more to you than that, but...Well…"

    Ciel "I’m not always right, you know?"

    Ciel "I can’t tell you why you’re here. You made the choice to join me yourself, so I ought to be asking *you* that question, no?"

    Jean "That’s not what I meant, and you know that."

    Ciel "Oh, you really must learn to lighten up sometimes, Monsieur Hobier--"

    Jean "Jean. Call me Jean."

    Ciel "Oh, but that would be terribly boring, wouldn’t it? Everyone calls you Jean. I don’t want to be lumped in with everyone."

    Jean "Then what is it you want?"

    Ciel "Ah, and now we’re asking the right questions, aren’t we?"

    Ciel "I want a number of things, Monsieur Hobier. First, I want to understand why you’re so determined to keep everyone from knowing the kind of man you really are."

    Jean "Pft. And what sort of man is that?"

    Ciel "The good sort. You lied to me earlier. You aren’t trying to become a doctor because it pays well, you’re doing it because you wanted to...What...what was it, again?"

    Ciel "‘Do my part, no matter how small?’ You had offers from every university in the EU. You could have been an astronaut if you wanted to be."

    Ciel "But instead, you want to be a doctor. And not just any doctor -- a doctor who works for those who can’t afford the service. Why?"

    Jean "How did you…?"

    Ciel "Oh, I know a great deal more about you than you think. Or did you think we met coincidentally? I’ve had my eye on you."

    Jean "But how? And why? You had to know I’d be of no use to you."

    Ciel "The answer to one of those questions is much more interesting than the other, I think."

    Jean "Ugh. Claude."

    Ciel "You should be honored. He really thinks quite a lot of you, you know. More than you think of yourself, I think."

    Jean "So you two are...together, then?"

    Ciel "What? Oh god no. We’re just friends. Claude is a good guy, don’t get me wrong. He has a big heart, and he’ll do anything for a friend, even one he just met. But…"

    Ciel "Well, you know what I’m talking about, don’t you? He’s a bit…"

    Jean "Simple?"

    Ciel "Haha, yes. Yes, that summarizes him perfectly. I prefer my men have a bit of nuance to them, and I’m not sure Claude even knows the meaning of the word."

    Jean "You have no idea…"

    Ciel "I’m sure I don’t. No, I have no interest in Claude like *that*, though I’m not sure he shares that feeling…"

    Jean "So you’ve known him for a while, then?"

    Ciel "A few months. He first wandered into our club back at the beginning of the semester. Heard it had a lot of girls."

    Jean "Of course."

    Ciel "Sounds like this isn’t the first time that’s happened."

    Jean "It isn’t. I’m not sure he has other motivations."

    Ciel "Ah, I don’t know about that. You sell your friend short. I wouldn’t have suffered him for long were he just out to get laid, you know."

    Jean "So you two are just friends? Then why do you know anything about me?"

    Ciel "Ah, well. We have and...arrangement. I introduce him to some of the more eligible members of the club, and in return…"

    Jean "He tells you about me...But why? You're the largest political club on campus, maybe in all of Paris. What makes me worth your attention?"

    Ciel "You have a peculiar set of attributes that makes you interesting and, I hope, useful."

    Jean "I’m not joinin--"

    Ciel "No, no. I’m not asking you to do that. At least not yet. Let’s get to know each other a bit, first, then I’ll explain. Sound fair?"

    Jean "...Whatever."

    Ciel "Ah, no need to look so cross! No one is keeping you here but yourself. If you want no part in my...what was it again? Neo-Jacobinism? If you want nothing to do with it, then just go home."

    Ciel "But we both know you won’t do that, don’t we? We both know that what you want is very different from what you say you want, isn’t it?"

    Jean "Don’t push it."

    Ciel "Of course, of course. So tell me. What’s your story? Why does someone who so desperately wants to help people refuse to fight for a government who will?"

    Jean "Because there’s no such thing. You can replace one set of government dogs with another, but you’ll still only have a pack of dogs. The fundamental nature will be the same."

    Ciel "So you think it is a problem with the nature of government, then?"

    Jean "Not with the government. With power. One sip of power, then all you can think about is holding onto it. Nothing else matters. Doesn’t matter what sort of person you were before."

    Ciel "Interesting. What makes you think that way?"

    Jean "Let’s call it personal experience."

    Ciel "Go on."

    Jean "It’s a bit private."

    Ciel "Maybe, but you’re the one who brought it up, didn’t you? Don’t you want me to understand? The way no one else does?"

    Jean "What are you…"

    Ciel "Am I wrong? Isn’t that why you push people away? You’re tried of trying to explain yourself, without being understood?"

    Jean "... … …"

    Ciel "Oh, yes. Here, try a bite of this, I insist. It’s really the finest crepe in the neighborhood."

    Jean "*bites*"

    Jean "It is...Quite good."

    Ciel "Right? I don’t know how Madam does it. She balances the spices so perfectly."

    Jean "..."

    Jean "What are you doing? Why all this?"

    Ciel "What am I ‘doing’? Nothing. I’m being myself. Don’t you wish you could do the same?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "My father. It was my father. He was an attorney. A good one. He never said no to anyone, even clients who couldn’t pay. Said that ‘justice has no price’."

    Jean "When I was a boy, I wanted nothing more than to be like him. And why not? Everyone loved Papa, and he did a lot of good for a lot of people."

    Ciel "Did. Past tense. What happened?"

    Jean "He took a case. Ended up rooting out a massive corruption ring in the departmental government. He won, and suddenly half the department was turning in their resignations."

    Jean "Naturally, they needed to be replaced. At first, my father showed no interest, but everyone kept asking him to join the government...and eventually he did run for office."

    Jean "He won easily, of course. He was the most famous man in the neighborhood, by then."

    Ciel "Then?"

    Jean "You already know. It’s quite predictable, isn’t it?"

    Jean "At first, he really tried to do good by the people, but...That was easier said than done. ‘The People’ Aren’t very good at agreeing on what they want."

    Jean "He was nearly upset in the next election. His opponent was a suit filled with slime. A real conservative batard. Even still, it was a close thing."

    Jean "He changed after that. Cared more about getting elected than doing anything once he was. Eventually, I couldn’t tell him apart from the men he replaced."

    Ciel "I see. So you believe there’s no such thing as a good person in government, then?"

    Jean "I haven’t seen a counterexample, and I was surrounded by politicians growing up. Father said he wanted to get into office to help people. Spread liberty, justice, and all the other greater hits."

    Jean "It is all well and good to say you stand for liberty and justice, but that is the easy part. Danton, Thiers, even Robespierre all said the same, no?"

    Jean "Yet, when it came time to rule, none were strong enough to take a stand for what they so eloquently professed to believe in, did they? They unseated tyrants, only to become tyrants themselves!"

    Jean "That what power does. It turns people into the things they most hate. My father was on different, and I’m not arrogant enough to assume I would be, either. So prefer not to test myself."

    Ciel "I get it."

    Ciel "..."

    Jean "..."

    Jean "So, what about you?"

    Ciel "Hmm?"

    Jean "Well, it’s not exactly normal for a girl your age to want to overthrow the government, is it? Or do you get to ask all the questions?"

    Ciel "Haha! Fair is fair, I suppose."

    Ciel "I don’t, for the record."

    Jean "Don’t what?"

    Ciel "Don’t want to overthrow the government. I’m not *quite* as naive as you paint me. I can read history books too, you know. I’m not the convenient Jacobin punching bag you’d like me to be, sorry to say."

    Jean "I never called you a--"

    Ciel "Punching bag? No, but you implied it in your little speech. You enjoyed looking down your nose at me, didn’t you?"

    Jean "I...Well. Maybe I did...but I shouldn’t have. It’s been a long week and….Well, there’s no excuse. It was wrong of me."

    Ciel "Hmm. Impressive. I like that."

    Jean "Like what?"

    Ciel "The way someone admits they’re wrong says a lot about someone."

    Jean "And what does it say about me?"

    Ciel "That maybe you’re not as much of a connard as everyone says."

    Jean "..."

    Ciel "Anyways, back to business. All I want is a government which takes care of people. Is that so much to ask? What else are they there for otherwise?"

    Ciel "I don’t mind if this one stays, as long as it stops lining the pockets of the rich, and starts looking out for the people who actually elect them. If they won’t...Well. I can’t say I’m attached, either."

    Jean "Do you think they ever will?"

    Ciel "I...I don’t know. I didn’t have the luxury of being raised by politicians like you or Claude. I hope so. The alternative is...messy."

    Jean "So you admit that you would overthrow the government, if it came to it."

    Ciel "Don’t judge me. I have my reasons, just like you have yours."

    Jean "Well, I shared mine. Let’s hear yours."

    Ciel "Oh? Is that curiosity I detect in your voice, Monsieur?"

    Jean "I don’t know what you’re talking about."

    Ciel "Really. Well, you’re in luck. I’m of a mind to humor you, even if you won’t play along. I’ll warn you, though. It’s not a pleasant tale."

    Ciel "My father was a gendarme. Worked himself to the bone for twenty-nine years, only to get laid off in the first round of austerity measures. Six more months and he’d have had his pension but...Well, that didn’t happen."

    Ciel "He tried to find work afterward. Tried really hard. But what kind of work is an aging ex-gendarme good for, anyways?"

    Jean "Merde. That’s a terrible spot to be in."

    Ciel "It was. Mom did her best to keep everything running, but...Well, eventually it was clear the ends weren’t going to meet anymore."

    Jean "So what happened?"

    Ciel "None of it ended up mattering. One day my father went out to look for work, passed out, and ran his car into a divider. They say he died instantly."

    Jean "Oh. I...I’m sorry."

    Ciel "Yeah. Thanks."

    Ciel "The insurance money is more than enough to take care of mom and I. Wouldn’t be in university without it, but…"

    Jean "But what?"

    Ciel "It’s... The night before the accident, I swear my father came into my room. I don’t know if I was dreaming, or half-asleep, but I remember him saying goodbye."

    Ciel "I’ve...Thought about that moment a lot. Wondered what would have happened if I had just said something, anything! Maybe he’d still be here."

    Jean "...You cannot think like that, Ciel. For all you know it was a dream."

    Ciel "I know. I know I should just forget and move on. Knowing that doesn’t make it any easier to do, though."

    Ciel "And...If I’m being honest, I don’t want to forget. I protest so that no one needs to have their dignity stripped away like my father did. If the world were just a bit more fair, no one would ever need to live through what I did."

    Jean "..."

    Ciel "Ah, look at me. I’m a mess. I should have known this would happen. I shouldn’t have brought it up."

    Jean "No, no. I’m...I’m glad you did. Thank you."

    Ciel "What for?"

    Jean "For giving me the chance to understand."

    Ciel "Ahh, see. I knew you weren’t so bad, after all. Why do you try so hard to hide that you’re a good man?"

    Jean "You overrate me. Basic sympathy doesn’t make a man good, just average."

    Ciel "Yet there are many who fail to do that much. How many managers listened to my father’s story, yet never lifted a finger to help him? Too many. Those men are the average, Jean."

    Jean "Perhaps. But what now?"

    Ciel "What now? Is it so hard to believe I asked you here just to talk?"

    Jean "You don’t seem the type to ‘just’ do anything."

    Ciel "So you’re accusing me of having ulterior motives?"

    Jean "Do you?"

    Ciel "Hahaha. Yes, of course I do. I’d like for you to join us."

    Jean "Why the hell would I--"

    Ciel "Hold on, hold. I know what you’re going to say. Will you let me explain, first?"

    Jean "...Fine."

    Ciel "Thank you. Now, you see, I’m not quite the silly girl you think I am. I’m well aware of the histories. You’re not the only one who can read."

    Ciel "The men you speak of, they all went astray because they were alone. Robespierre? How much of a tyrant was he while he still had Brissot and Donton to challenge him? Was it not only after he executed them that the terror truly began?"

    Ciel "You say that power corrupts the hearts of people, and I agree. Without the proper counterbalances, it always does. That’s why I want to make sure I’m never without that counterbalance -- friends who will warn me before I go astray."

    Ciel "Were I ever to come to power, I would keep a tight inner circle. People I trusted to help me stay true to my purpose. Friends that I know will speak up the moment I cross a line."

    Jean "You want to conduct politics via the power of friendship? And you think that makes you sound less like a silly girl?"

    Ciel "I never said I wasn’t a silly girl! Anyone in my line of work must embrace a certain level of fancy, don’t you think? I just said my head isn’t quite as far into the clouds as you think. I’m still a realist."

    Ciel "I know you’re right. Everyone is weak. Even me. Especially me. But that weakness is exactly why we all so fervently cling to one another, and to our dreams."

    Ciel "Maybe that makes us all simply fools. Fools yearning for a world which can never be. But, without each other -- without our dreams -- just what are we? Empty shells, waiting for the end?"

    Ciel "No. That’s not me. I will not go softly into the night. I will not give up the fight. It doesn’t matter if it’s a lost cause. It is still a cause, and that’s all I need. Don’t you wish you could say the same?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Ciel "Sorry. I got a little carried away. I do that, sometimes. Makes for good theatre. Conversation? Not so much."

    Jean "It’s fine."

    Ciel "The point is, I’m not going to stop until I have the power to help people, the way they ought to be helped. And I want you to join me, to help me stay on the straight and narrow."

    Jean "You want me to be your canary?"

    Ciel "Hmm...I hadn’t thought about it like that, but now that you mention it...Mon Canari. It has a certain ring to it, no?"

    Jean "No, it really doesn’t. And why me? You have the largest student club on campus. Surely you have some willing confidantes there. No need to drag me into this."

    Ciel "There are some It trust in  the club, yes, but they all have a weakness which you lack. A critical one."

    Jean "And what is that?"

    Ciel "They’re all so easily moved. Were they to gainsay me, I could easily overcome them with some flowery bit of speechifying. But you? You don’t care anything for that, do you?"

    Jean "Not if the underlying point isn’t valid, no."

    Ciel "Right! You cut right through the bullshit, and to the heart of a matter. That is just the kind of person I need most of all. A bloodhound who won’t be turned aside!"

    Jean "Oh, merde. Stop comparing me to animals."

    Ciel "Ahh...But don’t you find dogs cute? It’s a compliment, you know."

    Jean "Riiight."

    Ciel "So will you do it?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "Give me one reason I should."

    Ciel "Because if you don’t, a decade will pass and nothing will change. Then, one day, you’ll look down at some poor, homeless wretch on the street and you’ll know, with utter certainty, that you passed up the opportunity to make his life a better one."

    Ciel "And I don’t think you’d be able to live with that."

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "I could just give him some money, you know."

    Ciel "And you know that wouldn’t solve a thing, if the system which made him homeless remained intact."

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "Ah, boise moi mor. You are good at this."

    Ciel "Oh? Am I?"

    Jean "Allez, va t'en. Fine. But disregard me once, and I’m out. Understood? I’ll be your canary, or whatever it is you want, but the moment you walk off the straight and narrow, I’ll either be there to push you back onto it, or I’ll be out of your life forever. Got it?"

    Ciel "Just what I hoped for. Deal. And not a moment too soon, either."

    Jean "Why?"

    Ciel "Something big is coming, mon canari. All of the student political groups know it. A groundswell of frustration. You may have your work cut out for you soon."

    Jean "Lovely. So you were already planning on running off on the warpath?"

    Ciel "Ah, that is where you are mistaken, mon canari. I never leave the warpath. But that is a talk for another day, eh? Enough business. Tell me about your taste in women…"
