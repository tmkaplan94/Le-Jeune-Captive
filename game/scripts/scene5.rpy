    Jean "Hmm..."

    Jean "It was winter last year, just after midterms. I was enjoying some well-earned solitude at the local cafe when she first approached me..."

    Jean "I had seen her around the university before, of course, but never spoke--"

    Claude "Hey? What are you doing, mon ami?"

    Jean "What you wanted, connard. Telling the story of how Ciel and I met."

    Claude "Ahh! Ah, I see what you are trying to do! You are ashamed of the truth!"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "The truth? What is he talking about, Jean?"

    Jean "Absolutely nothing."

    Claude "Ah haha! It's nothing to be ashamed of! Well. For a normal person, maybe, but it's not like anyone would be surprised to hear you met while making a beauf o--"

    Jean "I did not! All of my objections were perfectly valid!"

    Claude "Maybe so, but there is a time and place for everything, yeah?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Objections? I'm confused. Did they not meet at the cafe?"

    Claude "They did see each other at the cafe, yes. And that might have been where they stared longingly into each other's eyes and felt the sting of cupid arrows, but...That is not where you met, is it Jean?"

    Jean "...It wasn't worth explaining."

    Claude "Oh, I think you are wrong there, mon ami. You cannot skip over the best part of the story!"

    Jean "Fine, fine! If you like it so much, you tell it, then!"

    Claude "Why, Jean...I never thought you would ask! I would be honored to tell the story of how your great romance be--"

    Jean "Ugh, is it too late to change my mind?"

    Claude "Far. Now, we will need to rewind a bit from the cafe...Same day, but in the afternoon. I had just finished flunking my last exam of the semester, and I was looking for some...companionship, yeah?"

    Jean "A girl. He was looking for a hook up. Pathetically."

    Claude "No need to be so crude, mon ami. I just wanted to share my elation at my newfound freedom with someone else. A beautiful someone else. Is that so wrong?"

    Jean "Most people would say yes."

    Claude "Bah! You say yourself, mon ami, that most people are idiots, no? Why should we care about them?"

    Jean "Because you are trying to get your bite wet?"

    Claude "Hey! Don't confuse me of harboring such base desires--"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Uhh...So, the story?"

    Claude "Yes, yes! That story. Where was I before I was so rudely interrupted?"

    Claude "Ah, the Young Pairisian meeting! Yes!"

    Claude "Jean had been locked in our room studying for weeks, so I thought it was time he got some fresh air. You know. Lived a little. So we went out together."

    Claude "We prowled the grounds together, looking to make merry, if you know what I mean. It was then that we bumbled into the Young Parisian rally. It looked like some kind of outreach event. Tons of speeches and what not, but most importantly..."

    Jean "Food. They had free food."

    Claude "I was going to say camaraderie, mon ami! Despite our constant poverty, we would never have stooped to joining a rally just for the food."

    Jean "Maybe you would not have..."

    Claude "Well, it does not matter. What does matter is that the first time we saw her speak. She was the last speaker, and she was magnificent! I thought I was watching a famous actress, not some university student! The crowd ate up her every word!"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "What was she speaking about?"

    Jean "Yeah, Claude? What was she speaking about?"

    Claude "Uhh...Well, the literal meaning was a bit lost on me, you see--"

    Jean "He was too busy oogling the rest of the crowd..."

    Claude "I was not! At that moment, I only had eyes for Ciel. It was as if a flame-wreathed seraphim had descended from the heavens and was speaking to us. Nothing else mattered to me but that I might get a chance to meet this lady who was unlike any other."

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Wait...but...You're making it sound like you were the one who fell for Ciel."

    Jean "He was."

    Claude "Alas, yes. The story of Jean and Ciel's undying love is also the story of my greatest heartbreak..."

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Oh, I'm sorr--"

    Jean "Don't flatter him. He never had a chance."

    Claude "Maybe I would have, had you just kept yourself out of it!"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Oh? So you stole her away, Jean? What happened?"

    Jean "It wasn't like that at all."

    Claude "At least, we agree. Jean only won Ciel's heart despite his best efforts. He was trying to be a good wingman, but alas..."

    Claude "After the rally, everyone milled around and enjoyed the pizza. I took the opportunity to approach Ciel and give her my regards. We were having a lovely little conversation, when a certain wet napkin made his way over..."

    Claude "No, I have not had the pleasure of reading his work. You will have to enlighten me sometime. Perhaps at dinner...?"

    Ciel "Oh, but I don't believe I could do it justice. You'll have to read it for yourself. It's a truly excellent wo--"

    Jean "Claude, come on. The lady is clearly not interested. Let's get out of here before they start raising up barricades."

    Claude "Barricades? To keep us in?"

    Jean "What? No! Barricades like the ones in-- You know what, never mind. Let's just get out of here."

    Ciel "Hahaha! Claude, I think your friend is afraid of getting caught up in a revolution, no?"

    Jean "Can you blame me, with the rhetoric you all have been throwing around?"

    Ciel "For believing we want a revolution? No. For wanting no part of it? Yes. If you're so against what we stand for, why are you even here?"

    Claude "I may have made him come... A mistake I now regret."

    Claude "If you're so miserable, mon ami, then just head home, yeah?"

    Ciel "Not yet, note yet. You've piqued my curiosity. Claude, what did you say your friend's name was?"

    Jean "Jean. Jean Hobier."

    Ciel "Jean. Right. So tell me Jean, what did you think?"

    Jean "Think of what?"

    Ciel "Our presentation today, what else?"

    Claude "Ah, Ciel, you are better off trying to get water out of a stone then praise from ou--"

    Ciel "That may be true, but I'm curious.You'll indulge me, won't you, Jean?"

    Jean "..."

    Jean "Are you sure you want to know?"

    Claude "Jean...Please do not make a sc--"

    Ciel "I'm sure."

    Claude "Oh merde..."

    Jean "..."

    Jean "I think you are the very worst sort of snake-oil vendors. You say your revolutionary ideals are a tonic, one that brings hope. I say they are a poison for the bearer, at best, and for all of society, at worst."

    Jean "You wrap yourself in the trappings of the \"grand\" revolution. You're happy to repeat the gilded words of a gilded age, an age you clearly have studied, no? Then why are you just as happy to ignore the bloody lessons that age taught our country!"

    Jean "You're a pack of delusional neo-Jacobins. You worship a revolution that preached liberty, fraternity, and equality, yet birthed none of them. Instead, it birthed a war-mongering Emperor worse than the Bourbons who came before and after."

    Jean "Our history is like a stage play, repeated endlessly. Despotism, revolution, relapse. The actors change, but the story is always the same. Tyrant-killers rise up, only to become tyrants themselves, or worse. And for the masses? Nothing changes but the name they pay homage to."

    Jean "You are children playing a dangerous, pointless game -- one that I want no part in. THAT is what I think."

    Claude "...Sorry, he gets a little worked up sometimes. The heat afflicts him s--"

    Ciel "Then you are happy, Jean? With the way things are? A country where some live in towers of gold, while others can't even afford to start their cars?"

    Jean "I did not say that."

    Ciel "But you don't want to do anything to change it?"

    Jean "I am. Why do you think I am in this university? So I can get a good job, keep my head down, and take care of myself and mine. What more can a man do in this world?"

    Ciel "What about everyone else? They don't matter as long as you're taken care of? Not everyone is as lucky as you, Jean."

    Jean "..."

    Ciel "So you agree something should be done to help them? The ones who are less privileged than you? Who can't just put their heads down and ignore the problem?"

    Jean "Of course I do! I'm not heartless."

    Claude "Usually not, at least..."

    Jean "But what can I do? I am just one man. I can't just wave my hands and make the world's problems go away."

    Ciel "You stand up and demand something be done."

    Jean "Did you hear nothing I just said? When has \"demanding something be done\" ever helped anyone?"

    Ciel "So, let me make sure I understand, then. You think something ought to be done, but you just don't want to be part of doing it?"

    Jean "That's not quit--"

    Ciel "So you are a coward."

    Jean "...Ah! Excuse me?"

    Ciel "You heard me. You can say that you're just being prudent. That history defends you argument. But all I hear are excuses."

    Ciel "You're right. Few of our country's revolutions resulted in immediate gain, yet here we are. In two hundred years we went from being slaves to kings and dukes to free citizens who elect our own leaders. And you tell me there's been no progress?"

    Ciel "Hide it all you want, but the truth is that you're so afraid to stand up for yourself that you've concocted all of these arguments to justify not. You don't really believe them. You're too smart for that, no? Yet...you must. Because if you do not, what kind of man does that make you?"

    Jean "A living one."

    Ciel "... ... ..."

    Ciel "Pft! Haha, I suppose it does, mousier Hobier. I suppose it does. And are you happy with that? Just living?"

    Jean "... ... ..."

    Jean "I'm leaving, Claude."

    Claude "Hey, hold on, mon ami! You can't just walk away like that!"

    Claude "*sigh*"

    Claude "I guess he can...I'm sorry about that."

    Ciel "Not at all. It's about what I expected. You were right, he's very...intense. A rebel without a cause, almost. I wonder if he's really happy, underneath that dour armor."

    Claude "Rarely, but he's a good guy, I promise. Just a bit of a connard now and again."

    Ciel "*chuckles* Well, aren't we all. Aren't we all..."

    Ciel "I don't mind. He gave me a lot to think about, and judging by his reaction, I did the same. That's worth a little grief, I think.."

    Claude "Oh, I don't know about that. His head's thicker than a mule's."

    Ciel "Hmm. I suppose we'll see. Aren't you going to go after him?"

    Claude "Ah, I suppose I should. Who knows what will happen to the first poor freshman who gets in his way if I don't."

    Ciel "Then you must hurry! Give me just a moment, though. May I borrow a pen?"

    Claude "Of course. Here. What do you need it for?"

    Ciel "Just a little note... There we go. Would you give this to Jean when you catch up with him?"

    Claude "Ah, Jean...Not again. How do you always...You're not even trying!"

    Ciel "Always what?"

    Claude "Nevermind. I'll give it to him, don't worry. See you again here next week?"

    Ciel "I'll be here. Now go!"
