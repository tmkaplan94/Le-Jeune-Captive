    "17 March, 2019 - The Safehouse"

    Newscaster "--the violence on the streets of the Champs-Elysées has reportedly left over 500 protestors and 15 military personnel injured. Eye witnesses report a few scattered fatalities, but authorities have yet to corroborate those reports. The President’s office did not reply to a request for comment."

    Newscaster "A curfew is now in effect on the streets of Paris between the hours of 19:00 and 4:00. We go now to footage of President Macron’s address to the nation, which he gave last night after sending in--"

    Claude "That’s enough of that, eh?"

    Jean "Hey! I was watching that."

    Claude "Aye, you were, mon ami. You’ve scarce done anything else since we got here. A break would do you some good, yeah?"

    Jean "..."

    Claude "Look, Jean. I know you are worried about her. We all are. But getting into a funk won’t help anything."

    Claude "Without Ciel, you are in charge now. At least try to look the part, yeah?"

    Jean "And why is that? I never asked to be in charge of anything! Look the part? I don’t want the part. I just want Ciel…"

    Claude "So do we all, but we will not find her by staying glued to the newscast all day, now will we?"

    Jean "*sigh*"

    Jean "I just...i just don’t know what to do, Claude. I am not Ciel. I cannot just go around and tell everyone it will be ok when I feel as though the sky has fallen!"

    Jean "She is a leader. She can lift people up. I am just a nurse. I can only put them back together."

    Claude "Well, Mr. Nurse, how about you start by putting yourself back together, then we can talk about what comes next, yeah? The way you look, you’d think you were the one to take a bullet."

    Jean "That bad, huh?"

    Claude "You smell like you just raided a liquor store, mon ami. Speaking of, you don’t have any of that brandy left, do you?"

    Jean "See for yourself…"

    Claude "Good god, Jean, I didn’t know you had it in you! The whisky too?"

    Jean "And the gin, the rum, the…"

    Claude "Okay, okay. I get the point. Clean yourself up, man. I’m surprised you’re still conscious."

    Jean "That’s funny, coming from you. Do you not remember the benders you used to drag me on? Where do you think I built up this tolerance?"

    Claude "No, mon ami, I do not. Remember, any night of debauchery you can remember the day after is a night poorly spent."

    Jean "Yeah, yeah. Ahh, merde! My head is about to explode. Get me some ice water, wil--"

    "*knock knock knock knock*"

    Jean "Baise moi! Who is that? The gendarme?"

    Claude "Relax, mon ami. The gendarme only knock with battering rams, not their fists. It is a friend."

    Jean "A friend?"

    Claude "Yeah. While you were busy drowning your sorrows, I was being a bit productive, yeah?"

    Claude "I’ve had our people out in all of the hospitals looking for Ciel. It was only a matter of time before she was found."

    Jean "Really? I..did not think you had it in you."

    Claude "Well, someone had to step up while you were drinking yourself into oblivion, no?"

    "*knock knock knock knock*"

    Claude "YEAH, YEAH, I’M COMING!"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "*huff huff*"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Claude! Jean! Thank god I found…*huff huff*"

    Claude "Hey, hey, hey. Take a breath, yeah? You look as bad as he does."

    Jean "Casse-toi. I’m fine."

    Claude "Yeah? Then bring her some water, why don’t you?"

    Jean "Alright, alrigh--"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "*huff huff* I found her!"

    Claude "You did?"

    Jean "Where?! Where is she? Come Claude, we have t--"

    Claude "Calm down, man. It is not safe for us outside. Did you not hear about the curfew?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "I’m..I’m sorry…"

    Jean "Why? What’s wrong?! Is she hurt?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Badly. I talked to some other protestors who saw her get taken. They described her perfectly."

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "They said she made time for them to get away. She...They say she fought the gendarme with only her fists."

    Jean "Oh, Ciel…"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "It...it gets worse. They..they beat her, and took her to a military hospital under arrest. I..I saw her there…"

    Jean "And? How is she?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "I...I couldn’t get close. There were so many guards...I didn’t want them to suspect…"

    Jean "How. Is. She?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "...Not good, Jean. It looks like they beat her pretty badly. She wasn’t conscious."

    Claude "Sweet god…"

    Jean "C'est des conneries! Come, Claude. We have to go!"

    Claude "Wha-- Mon ami, you must be kidding. To walk into there would mean certain capture…"

    Jean "Then what else do you want to do? We cannot just leave her there!"

    Claude "I don’t like it either, Jean, but think! Do you think marching in there and getting yourself killed will make Ciel any happier? Didn’t you hear her? That place is swarming with gendarme!"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "I’ve never seen so many..."

    Jean "Allez, va t'en! I’ll not leave her to the pigs!"

    Claude "No one is saying we should, mon ami. But we cannot just walk in there without a plan, and you’re in no condition to make one!"

    Jean "Ugh! Merde! Baise moi! Fais Chier!"

    Claude "Jean! This is not like you. You need to calm down, yeah? Fuming will do nothing to help Ciel. We need your mind right now, not...whatever this is!"

    Jean "*sigh*"

    Jean "Sorry. You are right. It’s just, when I think about her being beaten like that…"

    Claude "I know, I know. I feel the same way, mon ami. She is my friend too. Feeling better now?"

    Jean "Of course not, idiote. I’ll not be better until we have her back. But you are right. We cannot move yet."

    Jean "..."

    Jean "Thank you, Claude. I was not myself."

    Claude "No, of course you were not. What kind of man would be, with his love snatched away?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "So what do we do, Jean?"

    Jean "...I do not like it, but we cannot move yet. We need to regroup, and we need a plan."

    Claude "What sort of plan?"

    Jean "I...don’t know yet. I can’t think. Every time I try to, I just see her there…"

    Claude "Then we must turn our minds to happier times, yeah? Then you will be able to think clearly."

    Jean "‘Happier times’? How do you propose we do that?"

    Claude "That is easy, mon ami. Just tell a story about happy times, yeah? Oh, I know! Tell the story of how you and Ciel met!"

    Jean "Why? You were there. You already know how it happened."

    Claude "Yes, but she was not. She probably has no idea how it happened, right?"

    Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "No, but…"

    Claude "See? It is settled! Tell us a story, Jean!"

        Jean "Think of a plan to rescue Ciel?"

        Claude "And you think you will do a good job of it while you’re depressed and hung over? You are a smart man, Jean, but you are not a miracle worker. Well, I don’t think so, at least. Are you?"

        Jean "What? No, of course not!"

        Claude "Then take some time to set your mind at ease, yeah? You’ll think better that way, and you’ll entertain this lovely lady while you’re at it, right, my dear?"

        Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "Uhh…"

        Jean "Give it up, Claude. Can you not see she is married already? I can tell as romantic a story as you like, you still won’t score."

        Claude "What? Get your mind out of the gutter, Jean. I had no such int--"

        Jean "Don’t give me that. I saw where you were looking."

        Claude "At my best friend, with concern! Now will you tell the story, or not?"

        Jean "Lay off, Claude. Can you not see she is not into you?"

        Young_Parisian_Lieutenant "What?! I, I didn’t--"

        Claude "Jean, you wound me! Do you think so low of me? Your mind is in the gutter, my friend."

        Jean "If it is, it is only because you dragged it there. Now, get me some water while I figure out where to start…"
